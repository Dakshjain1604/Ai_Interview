# Project Title: Interview AI | Automated Technical Interview Platform

## Overview

This is a **React/TypeScript** Interview Platform utilizing **Redux Toolkit** for robust state management. It allows users to take a quick, **6-question, time-based technical interview** (currently supporting **Node.js/React**). The core logic, including dynamic question generation and answer evaluation, is powered by an **LLM (OpenAI API)**. After completing the interview, candidates and interviewers can view performance analysis on a dedicated **Dashboard**.

## Features

* **Resume Upload & Parsing:** Users can upload their resume (PDF, DOCX, or TXT). The application uses a dedicated utility to parse and scrape essential candidate details like **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone Number**.
* **Dynamic Interview Generation:** A set of **6 time-based questions** is generated by the LLM, balanced across three difficulty levels:
    * **2 Easy** (20 seconds each)
    * **2 Medium** (60 seconds each)
    * **2 Hard** (120 seconds each)
* **Automated Evaluation:** Candidate answers are sent to the LLM for objective scoring (out of 100) and a detailed performance summary.
* **Interviewer Dashboard:** A data visualization view for interviewers to track candidate performance, including:
    * Candidate details.
    * Overall score and ranking.
    * Detailed performance description.
* **Robust Interview Flow:** Includes features like **answer auto-submission** upon timer completion and a **Welcome Back** window for state recovery after a window reload.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, CSS.
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit.
* **API/LLM:** OpenAI API.
* **Parsing:** Utilities for handling PDF, DOCX, and TXT files.

# InterviewAI

A web application that allows users to upload their resume, take a time-based interview generated by an LLM, and get a detailed evaluation of their performance.

---

## Basic Code Flow

1. **Home Page:**  
   The user is prompted to upload their resume.

2. **Resume Parsing:**  
   The resume is parsed, and the user reviews the extracted data.

3. **Interview Start:**  
   The LLM generates 6 questions, and the user starts the time-based interview.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Upon completion (or auto-submit), the answers are sent to the LLM for evaluation, resulting in a score out of 100 and a detailed performance description.

5. **Dashboard:**  
   The candidate's final performance data is available for viewing on the interviewer dashboard window.
